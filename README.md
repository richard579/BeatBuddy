## My Story
BeatBuddy was born out of a love for music and the desire to create a platform that understands and caters to each user's unique taste. In a world filled with endless music options, I wanted to build a companion that not only recommends songs but becomes your musical soulmate. The journey to create BeatBuddy was both exhilarating and challenging. I underestimated the work that would have to be put in and research and was unable to incoporate an algorithm as I wanted. Behind the code and pixels, is a passionate individual. I am a music lover, dreamer, and creator who believes in the power of technology to enhance our lives. BeatBuddy is not just a project; it's a reflection of a person who poured their heart into it. As we envision the next iteration of BeatBuddy, I hope to have the app up and running with a proper algorithm, I aim to delve deeper into user personalization, exploring new ways to connect users with the music they love. Your feedback is invaluable, and together, we can shape the future of BeatBuddy into something truly extraordinary.
